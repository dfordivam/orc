WINDOWS INSTALLATION STEPS

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Please follow these steps to install RoR on your local windows machine:
 (NOTE: You need to be connected to the internet throughout the
 installation process)


 1)      Ruby as a language can be downloaded as a standalone software,
 but if you wish to create web application, you must install Rails,
 WebServer, MySql DB etc.

 So better to download "InstantRails".  It is a complete package with
 Ruby, RubyGems, Rails, WebServer(Apache), MySql DB and sample rails
 applications(viz. cookbook and typo).

 Here is the link to download the zip file:

http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=904 (Download InstantRails-2.0-win.zip)

 This comes up with ruby version 1.8.6 and rails version 2.3.4. Later
 we will install ruby version 1.8.7 also.


 2)      Now Unzip "InstantRails-2.0-win.zip"under the dir
 C:\InstantRails. That's it !!

                Now you can see:

 o   Ruby executable: "C:\InstantRails\ruby\bin\ruby.exe"

 o   InstantRails executable: "C:\InstantRails\InstantRails.exe"

 o   RubyGems: "C:\InstantRails\ruby\lib\ruby\gems\1.8"



 3)      Set Windows PATH variable to include
 "C:\InstantRails\ruby\bin\ruby.exe", "C:\InstantRails\mysql\bin\",
 "C:\InstantRails\", "C:\InstantRails\mysql"

 Note: To verify everything is done correctly, use the command "ruby
 -v" in DOS prompt to check the Ruby version:

 C:\Users\Administrator>ruby -v

 ruby 1.8.6 (2007-09-24 patchlevel 111) [i386-mswin32]

 Great !! Ruby is configured with the version 1.8.6!!



 4)      Now we will Install Ruby version 1.8.7 (Note that we can
 install as may versions as we need)

 Download "rubyinstaller-1.8.7-p352.exe<http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/75107/rubyinstaller-1.8.7-p352.exe>"
 from the URL: http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=167 and install.

 Better you install it under earlier created C:\IntantRails

 Also setup the Windows PATH variable to this location also.



 Now download the rubygems
 "rubygems-1.8.11.zip<http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/75474/rubygems-1.8.11.zip>"
  from http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=126 and extract it to "gems"
 dir.

 You can find this dir somewhere
 "C:\IntantRails\Ruby1.8.7-p352\Ruby1.8.7\lib\ruby\gems\1.8\gems\"

 After extracting, go inside the folder and run below command in DOS
 prompt (You should see setup.rb file inside the folder):

 ruby setup.rb



 Once it is done, run below command to install "rails" gem:

 gem install rails



 5)      You have successfully installed two different ruby versions now.

 In order to use/manage those, you must have ruby manager. For windows
 it is "pik"

 So use below command to get "pik":

 gem install pik

 mkdir C:\pik

 pik_install C:\pik

 pik add C:\InstantRails\Ruby1.8.7-p352\Ruby1.8.7\bin  (i.e. "bin" path
 of the newly installed ruby)


 Now you can use "pik" commands (pik list, pik switch etc.. to manage
 different ruby versions)

 Thanks,
